# HelioHex

This repository contains my work for a dynamic LED lighting display project.

### Demo

(Coming soon)

### Features

* Different lighting 'modes' - examples include:
	* Set the color of the whole display
	* Set the color of individual hexagons
	* Generate a random aesthetically-pleasing color palette
	* Sync the color of the display to the time of the day
* Spotify integration
	* Matches up the colors of each hexagon to the features of the song playing
	* Changes depending on the emotions of the song e.g. sadder songs are more blue
* Adaptable web controller - use any device on the network to control the device
	* Control all the different modes and brightness of the display
	* Shows a virtual visualization of the display
* Flexible design
	* Arrange the hexagons in whatever pattern you like - change the settings in one file and everything automatically updates
	* Each hexagon acts as its own unit - if you build more hexagons, you can easily expand the structure
